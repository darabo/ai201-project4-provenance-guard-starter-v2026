"""
Turning two numbers into one, and one number into something a person can read.
← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONES 4 AND 5

Two functions live here, and both are stubs.

`combine_signals` is where your false-positive decision from Milestone 1
actually gets made. Everything above it — the labels, the appeal path — is
downstream of a number this function produced.

`score_to_label` is where you stop writing for a machine and start writing for
a person. A score of 0.62 means nothing to a writer.

⚠️ Your README's **Signals and Scoring** section has to name the file and
function holding your combining rule. The grader checks your code against what
you claim, so that line should read `scoring.py::combine_signals`.

def combine_signals(model_score: float, style_score: float, marker_score: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """
    Combine two 0–1 signals into one 0–1 score. ← TODO (Milestone 4)

    Both inputs point the same way: higher means more likely AI. Your output
    should too.

    Args:
        model_score: from `detector.model_signal` — how predictable the text is.
        style_score: from `stylometry.style_signal` — the shape of the text.

    Returns:
        A float from 0.0 (confidently human) to 1.0 (confidently AI).

    ⚠️ **Write the rule down before you code it, and put the numbers in your
    README.** A weighted average is the obvious choice and it is not the only
    one. Things worth thinking about:

      - **What happens when they disagree?** One signal at 0.9 and the other at
        0.1 averages to 0.5 — "unsure". Is that what you want? It might be
        exactly right: two methods disagreeing IS uncertainty. Or you might
        decide one signal is more trustworthy when they split.

      - **Which way do you want to be wrong?** Weighting toward the signal that
        reads more human means fewer false accusations and more AI text
        getting through. There's no weighting that avoids the trade.

      - Milestone 4 asks you to find a case where your two signals split and
        write it down. That case is what this rule exists to handle.

    The weights in config.py are placeholders. Change them, or ignore them and
    write a different rule.

    My rule, with the reasoning for every number, is written out above the
    weights in config.py. In short:

      1. base: the equal-weight average of model_score and style_score.
      2. marker boost: stock phrases (marker_score, the stretch third signal)
         can only push the score up, never down.
      3. agreement guard: unless at least two signals lean AI, the score is
         capped just below AI_THRESHOLD, so one signal alone can't produce a
         high-confidence AI label.

    marker_score defaults to 0.0 so a caller with only the two required
    signals still gets steps 1 and 3.
    """
    # Step 1: the two required signals, weighted equally.
    base = (
        config.WEIGHT_MODEL_SIGNAL * model_score
        + config.WEIGHT_STYLE_SIGNAL * style_score
    )

    # Step 2: one-way marker boost. (1 - base) is the room left before 1.0,
    # and the boost takes at most MARKER_BOOST (30%) of that room.
    score = base + config.MARKER_BOOST * marker_score * (1.0 - base)

    # Step 3: the agreement guard. Count signals that lean AI on their own.
    agreeing = sum(
        s >= config.AGREEMENT_LEVEL for s in (model_score, style_score, marker_score)
    )
    if agreeing < config.MIN_AGREEING:
        # 0.01 under the line: still the top of "unsure", never "AI".

def score_to_label(score: float) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Turn a score into a guess and the text a reader actually sees.
    ← TODO (Milestone 5)

    Returns:
        (guess, label_text) — where `guess` is a short machine-readable string
        like "ai" / "human" / "unsure", and `label_text` is the full sentence
        shown to a person.

    ⚠️ Write the label text for someone who has never heard the word
    "threshold".

        ✗ "human, 0.81 confidence"
        ✓ "We think this was probably written by a person."

    All three labels have to be **reachable**. If no score can produce one of
    them, your ranges have a gap — and Milestone 5 asks you to submit text that
    produces each one, which is how you'd find out.

    The hardest one to write is "unsure". It has to admit uncertainty without
    sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
    written every word themselves. Your breakout asks your group what they'd
    think if they got it on their own work. That question is the whole
    milestone.
